DXWindow
=========
DXWindow is a small layer over DXGI written for C++ applications that
simplifies the process of creating and using a window.  Think of it as
GLUT for DirectX.  As a window-specific library, it makes use of the
COM ABI.  Its intent is to provide a fast, easy way to create a window
that behaves well.
